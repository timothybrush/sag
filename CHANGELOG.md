# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Explicit `--format` values now override output-extension inference, preserving the requested ElevenLabs audio format. (#21/#22, thanks @100yenadmin)

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-11
### Added
- Added live-tested 60db provider support via `/default-voices`, `/myvoices`, and `/tts-synthesize`, including bounded NDJSON decoding, incomplete-response rejection, and PCM-to-WAV playback. (#20, thanks @manishEMS47)
### Changed
- Release archives now include target-specific macOS and Linux assets for Homebrew and aqua installers.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-06
### Added
- Voice discovery: semantic `--query` over name/description/labels, repeatable `--label` filters, preview playback via `--try`, metadata caching, and server-side name search when supported.
- Bare `sag` now reads piped stdin like macOS `say`, so `echo "hello" | sag` speaks the text without requiring the `speak` subcommand. (#14, thanks @atdrendel)
### Fixed
- `--format` and `.ogg`/`.opus` output paths now request native ElevenLabs Opus output instead of always receiving MP3. (#16, thanks @derspotter)
- Long TTS generation no longer hits hidden 60s/90s internal timeouts; use `--timeout` or `SAG_TIMEOUT` when you want `sag` to enforce a limit. (#17/#18, thanks @sumurtk2)
- `--no-play` and `--no-stream` are now accepted aliases for `--play=false` and `--stream=false`.
- macOS playback now defaults to `afplay` for better AirPlay routing, with `--player oto` / `SAG_PLAYER=oto` available as a fallback. (#15, thanks @s0up4200)

## 0.2.2 - 2026-01-24
### Fixed
- Voice ID resolution respects `--voice-id` and avoids misclassifying long names; `--rate` now overrides `--speed` validation. (#7, thanks @joelbdavies)
- Voice name matching now uses exact/substring checks without falling back to unrelated voices; voice search is handled client-side. (#8, thanks @joelbdavies)
- `sag help` and `sag completion` no longer default to `speak`. (#4, thanks @GiGurra)
### Added
- `--api-key-file` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY_FILE`/`SAG_API_KEY_FILE` support for loading API keys from a file. (#6, thanks @GiGurra)

## 0.2.1 - 2026-01-01
### Fixed
- `-o/--output` now disables speaker playback by default unless `--play` is explicitly set. Previously `-o` saved to file AND played through speakers, which was confusing.

## 0.2.0 - 2025-12-19
### Added
- Voice control flags: `--stability`, `--similarity`/`--similarity-boost`, `--style`, `--speaker-boost`/`--no-speaker-boost`.
- Request controls: `--seed`, `--normalize (auto|on|off)`, `--lang` (ISO 639-1).
- `--metrics` to print basic request stats (chars/bytes/duration) to stderr.
- `sag prompting` command and README section with prompting tips.
### Changed
- Default model is now `eleven_v3` (override with `--model-id eleven_multilingual_v2` for a stable baseline).

## 0.1.1 - 2025-12-19
### Changed
- Release metadata only (patch bump).

## 0.1.0 - 2025-12-08
### Added
- Initial release of `sag` ElevenLabs TTS CLI with macOS `say`-style flags.
- Streaming default playback to speakers with optional file output; cross-platform audio via go-mp3 + oto.
- Voice listing (`sag voices`) and voice resolution by name/ID, including `?` to list.
- macOS `say` compatibility: `-v/--voice`, `-r/--rate`, `-f/--input-file`, `-o/--output`, plus accepted no-op flags.
- Auto-routing bare `sag ...` text/flags to `speak` subcommand, including npm/pnpm `--` pass-through support.
- Speed control (`--speed` or `--rate`), latency tier selection, model/format overrides with extension inference.
- Default voice fallback to first available when none provided; env support `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` or `SAG_VOICE_ID`.
- Config via `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`/`SAG_API_KEY`; `--api-key` and `--base-url` overrides.
- Tests for format inference, text sourcing, voice resolution helpers, and default `speak` routing behavior.
- Help/README improvements: feature overview, examples for subcommand-less usage, and voice discovery guidance.
- Homebrew tap formula (`brew install steipete/tap/sag`) and release playbook.
- CI workflow (lint + tests) and golangci-lint config.
- Documentation: README, docs/spec.md, and usage examples.
- Version flag (`--version` / `-V`) reporting 0.1.0; help available without API key.
